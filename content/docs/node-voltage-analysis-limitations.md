# Node-voltage analysis does not always work

## Statement

Many people believe that node-voltage analysis can be used to determine voltages and currents for all circuits that contain only voltage sources, current sources, and resistors. This is false. Node-voltage analysis (where we use Kirchhoff's current law *only*, not [modified nodal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_nodal_analysis)) does not always work!

## Proof

Consider the following circuit.
